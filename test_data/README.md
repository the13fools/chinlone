This folder contains a number of test examples generated by the script in this project.  

There are two base models.
1. Cube
- The cube should have: 12288 faces, and 6146 verticies

2. Tet 
- The tet should have: 4096 faces, and 2050 verticies 

There are number of folders that are formatted like: shape _ angle (where angle is measure relative to having the field be axis aligned).

Each folder contains numbered text files (0.txt, 1.txt, ect).  Each of these files should correspond to an F x 3 matrix, where each row corresponds to a vector per face of the mesh.  

Each folder also contains a "merged.txt" file which combines these vector fields to create an F x 9 matrix (for tets) or an F x 12 (for cubes).
